# Linux AutoConf

This is a bash script to automatically install several usefull softwares and to removes others
- the list of packets to install can be edited  in file installlist.txt
- the list of packets to remove can be modified by editing removelist.txt

I use it to save time after installing Linux Mint (or Ubuntu or any variant). It automatically install basic programs I use as well as various necessary system packages/libraries 


## TODO : 
- move functions to other file
- offer themes installations
- make the script available in french and english
