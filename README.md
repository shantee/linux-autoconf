![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shantee/linux-autoconf/master/logo.png "Linux AutoConf")

This is a bash script to automatically install several usefull softwares and to removes others
- the list of packets to install can be edited  in file installlist.txt
- the list of packets to remove can be modified by editing removelist.txt

I use it to save time after installing Linux Mint (or Ubuntu or any variant). It automatically install basic programs I use as well as various necessary system packages/libraries 

# How to use it ?

EASY !
1) open terminal and copy / paste
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shantee/linux-autoconf/ --progress

cd linux-autoconf

./autoconf.sh
```
(you may have to chmod +x autoconf.sh if the script doesn't start)


## TODO : 
- [] move functions to other file
- [] offer themes installations
- [] make the script available in french and english
